# Lucas's "Boilerplates"

Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Lucas, a 24-year-old tech enthusiast from Germany, and I love to inspire and educate people in IT.

This Repository **Boilerplates** is my personal template collection. Here you'll find templates, and configurations for various tools, and technologies.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my YouTube Channel: [LucEast](https://www.youtube.com/LucEast)\
Or my Blog: [LucEast.de/blog](https://www.luceast.de/blog/)
